# NCTU_dlp
## lab1
- Implement neural network by hand craft ,include feed forward and backpropagation and so on...
- Back propagation is the most difficault part to hand craft
## lab2
- EEG classification ,use pytorch creat simple deep neural network to predict eeg signal 
## lab3
- Diabetic Retinopthy Detection (糖尿病所引發的視網膜病變),like lab2 ,just classify picture to 5 class
- The Dataset is big ,training 10 epoch in RTX2080ti need 10 hours(or above)
- [dataset link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RTmrk7Qu9IBjQYLczaYKOvXaHWBS0o72/view)
## lab4
- Conditional VAE For Video Prediction,use VAE for robotic arm future movement prediction
- Modification a paper 
- dataset is quite big too,the most difficult lab in this course
## lab5
- GANs,a simple condition Gan pratice ,generate pseodo object

## lab6
- Deep Q-learning(DQN) and Deep Determinstic Policy Gradient(DDPG),in a moon landing game enviroment, let the space ship landing security
- A tradition cocntrol system problem and use Reinforcement learning to solve it
- Don't need dataset
